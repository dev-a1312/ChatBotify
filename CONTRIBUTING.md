### Contributing
If you are looking to contribute to the project, you may find the [**Developer Guide**](https://github.com/tjtanjin/react-chatbotify/blob/main/docs/DeveloperGuide.md) useful.

In general, the forking workflow is encouraged and you may open a pull request with clear descriptions on the changes and what they are intended to do (enhancement, bug fixes etc). Alternatively, you may simply raise bugs or suggestions by opening an [**issue**](https://github.com/tjtanjin/react-chatbotify/issues) or raising it up on [**discord**](https://discord.gg/6R4DK4G5Zh).

Note: Templates have been created for pull requests and issues to guide you in the process.
